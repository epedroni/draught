    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Eduardo Pedroni. I am an electronic engineer, though I lean more towards the software side of things. I am an active musician, specialising mostly on electric guitar with a bit of acoustic and classical around the edges. I enjoy cross-country cycling and hiking when the weather cooperates, and will casually play football from time to time. I am also slowly working through my embarrassingly large Steam library, one game at a time. I enjoy reading fantasy and sci-fi books and try to always be in the process of reading one.</p>

    <h1>Research Experience</h1>
    <p><strong>Neutral Mutations in Cartesian Genetic Programming</strong></p>
    <p>Genetic drift is an important aspect of Cartesian Genetic Programming, setting it apart from other genetic programming methods. As part of the biologically inspired computing course I attended in university, I investigated the neutral mutations which give rise to genetic drift by implementing variations of an explicitly neutral mutation operator. I produced a paper detailing the experiment and its results, which can be found <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/docs/Neutral-Mutations-in-Cartesian-Genetic-Programming.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en">Fraunhofer ISE</a></strong>
    <span class="hidden-xs" style="float:right">July to September 2010</span>
    <span class="visible-xs-inline"><br/>July to September 2010</span>
    <br/>Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany</p>
    <p>During this summer internship I produced a literature survey of solar cell imaging methods, and then performed photoluminescence imaging and resistivity measurements in order to determine the characteristics of various experimental types of photovoltaic solar cells. As a scientific research institution, the ISE was a rather different environment than the one I was used to (school) and that gave me good insight into how research is done in the "real world".</p>

    <h1>Skills</h1>
    <p class="sub-header">Programming</p>
    <p>I did a fair amount of programming over the course of my degree, in a variety of contexts. I am well acquainted with object-oriented programming as I have worked with Java and C++ before. I also worked on lower level projects like embedded systems, which were done in C and assembly. I have some experience scripting in Python, Bash and Javascript, and regularly write simple scripts to automate repetitive daily tasks.</p>
    <p class="sub-header">Markup Languages</p>
    <p>I am always hesitant to include HTML under programming, hence this category. As evidenced by this website, I have knowledge of HTML and CSS, and I have written parsers for XML and JSON in the past. I also made the transition to LaTeX in my last year of university, and have not looked back since. I write posts for this website in Markdown.</p>
    
    <p class="sub-header">Hardware Design</p>
    <p>I have worked on both analogue and digital circuit design tasks. Analogue circuits consisting of low-level components and op-amps were typically designed in software, implemented on breadboards, and after testing, soldered onto the PCB. I also designed many low-level digital circuits in VHDL and used FPGAs to verify their operation.</p>
    
    <p class="sub-header">Software Engineering</p>
    <p>In my studies I took an interest in software engineering, which led me to research methodologies and apply them to my work. I have a good knowledge of quality assurance procedures and metrics in software development, having worked on a project which required QA to be recorded. I am a supporter of the Agile methodology, which I tend to apply to most things I work on. I am comfortable with version control systems such as Git, and I am familiar with many software design patterns commonly used in software engineering. I am well acquainted with test-driven development as part of agile development iterations.</p>
    
    <p class="sub-header">Operating Systems</p>
    <p>I have used Windows since Windows 95, though in 2013 I made the transition to Linux, currently my primary OS. I started off using Ubuntu, moved on to Linux Mint, and now finally settled on Arch Linux due to its streamlined philosophy. I currently use stock Android on my phone but have used many custom ROMs since the Gingerbread generation.</p>
    
    <p class="sub-header">Music</p>
    <p>I have played guitar since 2001 and started learning music theory in 2009. I took part in many musical productions in school, which taught me formal skills like performing a composition as part of an organised ensemble with a conductor. I have recently started focusing on methodically improving my guitar technique by practicing with a metronome and concentrating on producing a cleaner sound.<br/> 
    I am also interested in musical production, which I have done on and off since 2009. I make recordings of the instruments I can play, and use MIDI sequencing to write the parts for those I can't play or don't own. My DAW of choice is Cubase, though I sometimes play around with Pure Data to make crazy filters.</p>
    
    <p class="sub-header">Soft Skills</p>
    <p>I am quite organised and methodical in my work. I enjoy working as part of a group, and have had good experiences in groups where all members were engaged in the task. Since I was brought up in a largely multicultural and international setting, I have no problem (and in fact welcome) working with people of mixed backgrounds; I believe people from different cultures bring in different ways of thinking, and that can drastically improve the outcome of a project.</p>
    
    <p class="sub-header">Legacy</p>
    <p>When I was around 11, I took three computer courses: Macromedia Flash MX, Dreamweaver MX and Fireworks MX. I made a few Flash games and a website or two in Dreamweaver before I moved on to other technologies. I still like Adobe Fireworks for image editing, but I find myself using it less and less now that I have switched to Linux.</p>
