A while ago, I posted two recordings that I did as part of my [recording studio techniques](/projects/recordings/2014/07/recording-studio-techniques) assignment. The first part of that assignment was a group recording, however, which I deliberately did not post because it really didn't turn out very good. I came across it again a few days ago and, what the hell, here it is:

Yes, it is a mess. It's a shame, too, because we worked so hard on it; hours and hours were spent mixing it. In retrospect, we should have taken a few days away from the song and then come back to it with fresh ears. This was the first serious mix any of us had ever attempted though, and I guess no one gets it right the first time.

We wrote the song together for the assignment, and it was never properly given a name. I sequenced the entire drum track using the [Addictive Drums](http://www.xlnaudio.com/addictivedrums/) VSTi. While I had written drum parts before, this was the first instance where I actually took the time to individually set the velocity for each note to truly emulate real drumming. The part itself isn't very idiomatic and there are a few bits which are impossible to play, but it does sound quite convincing. I also wrote and performed the guitar solo at the end (2:48). It doesn't really come through in the mix, but I was quite pleased with it at the time.

The reason why I am posting this is because I found another recording of this sound which is much more pleasant. While working on the stereo recording part of the assignment, my old housemate Joe and I set up a few of microphones in the living room and recorded a few songs to see if we liked the sound of the room. The following recording was largely improvised and done in a single take. I played the eletric guitar and Joe did the acoustic guitar and singing. I think we used one RØDE NT-55 for each guitar and a RØDE NT-2A for the vocals. No post-production was done beyond level normalisation.

I actually really like this rendition of the song. It's far from perfect of course, as is usually the case with jam sessions. The recording is rather quiet too, and I'm afraid little can be done about that. I tried compressing, but it doesn't work very well. The mix was done directly on the mixer during recording, and only a single stereo track was actually captured. Because of that, compressing the signal affects the stereo placement of the vocals very noticeably, so I prefer to turn up the computer volume and listen to the track as it should sound.

I think this just about covers my university recordings! I still record things from time to time at home, and I do have a few recordings I did with my cousins a long time ago, so I'll see if I can find those and post them on here next.
