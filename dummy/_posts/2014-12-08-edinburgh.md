I've been staying at a friend's house in Edinburgh for some time now, meaning I've had a little taste of what Edinburgh is like. I've been here before, but not for this long, and I felt compelled to write a blog post about this experience.

My friend's place is near the Meadows, a very nice park where I've been going running in the evening occasionally. This autumn has actually been very mild, with temperatures around 10Â° during the day and sunshine several times a week. The weather was so good the other day that I even tried to take a picture, though as I've mentioned before my Nexus 4 camera leaves a lot to be desired.

What I like about Edinburgh in general is that it has a big city feel, but at the same time it's a more manageable size than, say, London. It is definitely a change of pace compared to York, where I spent the last four years. I particularly like how a lot of the buildings in Edinburgh have a more conserved look to them. It's difficult to explain, but it has a more regal atmosphere to it. A lot of them are relatively recent (18th and 19th centuries), but they're still built out of stone and with comparative flair, unlike a lot of the more modest constructions in York.

After I graduated from university in York, I confess I was ready to call my time in the UK done and move on to different things. I enjoyed living here, but there were tiring aspects as well. I think the weather was a big factor for me, it was hard getting used to the short, cloudy days of winter. Being in Edinburgh has made me rethink that decision, though. It is a lively, bustling city that more than makes up for the lack of sunshine.
