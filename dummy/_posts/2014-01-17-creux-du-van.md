## Blogging

So. Blogging. I am new to this, so bear with me here. My intention is for this website to be a journal more than anything else, so I'll try and document anything noteworthy that happens in my life, hopefully not too long after it happens. I will kick things off with an entry about a hike I took with my girlfriend to the Creux-du-Van.

## Hiking

I enjoy hiking, cycling, and in fact pretty much any activity done out in nature. So last summer my girlfriend was visiting me, and we decided to hike up a moutain in Switzerland called Creux-du-Van. Actually the mountain itself is called [Le Soliat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Soliat), and Creux-du-Van is the name of a "rocky cirque" located on its north side:

I took that picture from Wikipedia. Unfortunately I don't have a very good camera, and even if I did, I am not very gifted in the ways of photography. I do have some photos taken with my phone camera, so for the record, here's one:

It was a fantastic hike. We left very early to take the train to Noiraigue. From there we headed to Ferme Robert and started up towards the "path of 14 curves", which was actually quite a tough trail, very steep and lots of big rocks to climb over. It was worth it though; the weather was splendid, so we sat under a tree and ate our sandwiches admiring the view at the top. Feeling refreshed and ready for more, we followed along the trail and went down the other side of the cirque, which was as steep, if not steeper than the way up. We were also overtaken by *many* elderly people on the way down.

I think it's safe to say we were not physically prepared for the trip, as evidenced by the subsequent soreness. According to [Schweizmobil](http://www.wanderland.ch/en/routes/route-0286.html) the trail is 14km in total, with a total altitude difference of 950m. It was fun times though, and we'll definitely try to do something like this again soon.
