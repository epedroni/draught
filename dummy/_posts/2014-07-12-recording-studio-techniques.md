In second year I took a module called recording studio techniques, where I learnt the basics of sound engineering. I was going through my backup folder and came across the two recordings I did for that module.

This is an instrumental recording of "Rebirth" by [Angra](http://angra.net/). This song has quite a nice classical guitar part which I learnt as one of my IB music performance pieces and chose to re-record for the studio techniques assignment.

This recording was done using three microphones: an x-y pair of RØDE NT55s was placed just below the guitar's sound hole, and a RØDE NT2-A was placed further away in omnidirectional to capture the room sound, since no artificial reverb was allowed for this recording. The recording was done in my bathroom, where I hoped to capture a nice reverberation from the smooth tiles. The final mix is composed of 10 different takes I recorded in order to cover up any mistakes and choose the best possible recording for each section.

## Multitrack Recording

The multitrack recording part of the assignment consisted of a conventional song recording done in the studio, one track at a time, with full post-production. This unnamed jazz piece is something I wrote in 2010 and then expanded for this assignment. It features a few interesting modulations and some improvised solos by me and a couple friends. The drums were originally sequenced in MIDI, but luckily I was able to get one of my cousins to play it on a real drumkit with nicer fills and dynamics than my MIDI part had.

Enjoy the tracks!
