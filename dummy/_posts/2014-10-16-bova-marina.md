Italy is a very interesting place. I tend to enjoy visiting old places, and Europe is littered with those, but Italy just has a completely different feel to it. It feels old. It's strange to be in a place and realise that, thousands of years ago, it was already an empire. Anyway, all thoughtfulness aside, I was in the south of Italy recently with a few friends and we went on a very nice hike up a hill in a small town called Bova Marina.

Well, let's talk about Bova Marina first. It was a strange place; the population was 3,870 in 2004 according to Wikipedia, and I really don't think it increased very much in the past 10 years. The atmosphere was placid, commercial establishments were very selective about their opening hours, and people seemed to spend a lot of their time sitting out on the sidewalk (where there was one).

Strangely enough, I got excellent reception on my mobile everywhere I went. I think there is one antenna for the whole town and not many people use their phones very actively, so I had a faster internet connection there than I do in most places in the UK. Speaking of the UK, here's another strange thing we found in Bova Marina:

We didn't get a chance to check it out, but it was a strange sight nonetheless. The highlight of the trip, however, was definitely the hike. I don't know if the hill even has a name, since it wasn't very high. We did time it perfectly though, and managed to get a spectacular view of the sun setting behind Mount Etna:

While in Bova Marina, we also had a very interesting experience at a local restaurant. At least I think it was a restaurant, it was hard to say. It was a backyard with many plastic tables and chairs. We walked in and were greeted by a confused-looking man. We asked if they were serving food and he said "sure". He took us to a table and he asked us what we wanted, so we asked what he had. "Fish", he replied. "What kind of fish?", we asked. He looked at us as if we were idiots and said "fish. Fried fish." He walked out and into another house (his, I hope), and came out a few minutes later with a plastic bag full of fish. He then brought us bread, some antipasti, water, and a bit later some fried fish and squid. When we were done eating and asked for the check, he just told us "fifty euro". Still a bit baffled as to what had just happened, we paid and left. It was either a very avant-garde gourmet restaurant or just a fisherman who saw an opportunity to make some quick cash from some tourists. 

Overall, though, it was quite an enjoyable trip. Nice hike, friendly people, good food, and so on. Want more? Here's some bonus content: in Reggio Calabria, just before we left, we witnessed the miracle of Italian driving in its fullest glory.
