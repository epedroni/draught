## Hollywood

I grew up in the less developed part of the western world, where American influence is good and strong. I ate American food, listened to American music, and of course, watched American films. I never found it strange that aliens only ever invaded the US, that it was always up to the US to destroy incoming meteorites and explore other planets, that natural disasters affected mostly the US, superheroes all spoke with American accents and the good guy is always white and handsome.

Some time has passed since my childhood, and I've had the chance to experience parts of the world somewhat less affected by American influence. I learnt history in school, not just American history but also the history of the rest of the world, from a historiographical perspective in which the good guy isn't always white and handsome. I think it is a natural development, therefore, that I find myself less and less interested in American films. I have come to find most of them *wearisome*; I find myself longing for a film that isn't set in the US, in which the main characters don't speak English, and it's not just about getting as wasted as possible in college. 

In that spirit, I have been trying to watch films from other countries. I watched [Cloud Atlas](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371111/), [Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120735/), [RocknRolla](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1032755/) and many others, but also more "exotic" films, like Bollywood productions. Most recently, however, I watched [A Most Wanted Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1972571/), and that's what I would like to briefly write about today.

## The Film

"A Most Wanted Man" tells the story of Issa Karpov, a Muslim Chechnyan who seeks refuge in Hamburg, Germany. GÃ¼nther Bachmann, a government agent tasked with infiltrating and extracting information from the local Muslim community, tracks Karpov from a distance and tries to use him to obtain more information about one of his main suspects, a man named Dr Faisal Abdullah. The film shows the difficulties faced by refugees entering European countries, as well as the political disputes among governments and even groups within the same government. I'll leave it at that in order to avoid spoilers.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it was an espionage film unlike any I have ever seen. Bachmann leads a team of "ghost" operatives; their existence isn't acknowledged by the government, so they keep a low profile and act from a distance almost exclusively. This actually makes the film very engaging to watch because it is very elegantly executed. Throughout most of the film, members of Bachmann's team are seen in the background, casually drinking coffee and talking to each other, while in fact monitoring suspects. When Bachmann finally decides to approach someone, for example, the way it happens is very different from the standard American car chase. Bachmann himself stands some distance away from the suspect's location, and waits for the suspect to hail a taxi. The taxi driver is actually one of Bachmann's operatives, who then stops next to Bachmann so he can get in the car with the suspect. This is a superbly executed scene, and in my opinion much more elegant than a car chase with multiple explosions and casualties, as is so common in modern action films.

It's hard for me not to get carried away and spoil the whole thing, so I think I'll leave it at that, but suffice it to say that it is definitely worth the watch. A breath of fresh air in comparison to the usual Hollywood espionage film, and of course, Philips Seymour Hoffman's last performance before his death.
