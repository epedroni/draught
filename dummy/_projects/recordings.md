## Description

I occasionally make recordings, usually of personal compositions but sometimes of covers as well. This isn't so much a project, but really just an ongoing activity. My intention is to write blog posts under this "project" so that all of my recordings are organised and easy to find.

All of my own works posted here are licensed under the same [CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license as the rest of the website. Any covers I post here are *not* my property and do not fall under this license; you may not make any money from them under any circumstance.
