## Free

It was a few years ago that I started thinking about open-source and freedom. I was looking into buying my first smartphone, and realised that the primary reason why Apple products "just work" is because they don't really let the user do much beyond what he or she is "supposed to". I admire that a company wants to offer solid products like the iPhone, but considering I intended to immerse myself in the world of technology, I realised I needed something more open to fiddling. I chose to go the Android way, which sparked my interest in open-source, free-as-in-speech software.

It is not my place to judge how companies make money and what they choose to make open or closed. As an end user, however, I am interested in how much money I have to pay to use something, and paying nothing for something that is continuously updated is much more appealing than paying something for something that will be outdated in a few years. So in 2013, I bought a new laptop and was given the option to pay £80 less and not get Windows with it. Since I could always get Windows from the university, I decided to save my £80 and try Linux instead.

## The Ubuntu Days

My first experience was with [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/). It was nice, a breath of fresh air after years of Windows, but it quickly grew stale. I had to install Windows alongside shortly after, because LibreOffice just isn't quite compatible with Microsoft Office. I then found myself using Ubuntu less and less, not because I didn't want to, but because often the tools I used were only available for Windows. I knew I would have to reboot into Windows at some point in the day, so I just booted straight into it every day. I ultimately removed my Ubuntu partition, and went back to Windows full time.

## The Arch Way

I still wanted to switch to Linux and, to the greatest possible extent, be free. Browsing through a list of popular distributions, I decided to find out more about [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/). It seemed like just the thing: keep-it-simple, no bloat, no frills, add your own bells and whistles. I followed the beginner's guide to install it, and was very happy about how transparent the whole process was. Partition the drive, download a bare image of Arch to the partition, chroot into it and configure it so you can reboot into it. I had to manually do a lot of what the Ubuntu installer did for me, but I liked that.

I have been using Arch ever since, and I must say I am very satisfied, though the transition into Linux is not yet complete. The beauty of Linux is that there is so much to tinker with, and I am certain I will never stop fiddling. This isn't so much a project, but if ever my fiddlings yield interesting results, I will write an entry about it under this category.
