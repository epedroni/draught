## Audio for Visual Media

The soundtrack is a big part of most modern films because, when properly executed, it sneaks past the audience's conscious perception of the film and enhances it. In fact, one of my lecturers once said that "a good soundtrack is one you don't remember." It makes sense; when you want to listen to music, you go to a concert. A film is something you *watch*, and so the sound should be there to support it rather than compete with it.

This is easier said than done, especially for conventional musicians and sound engineers. When writing a standalone piece of music, the composer's goal is usually to grab the attention of the audience. Similarly, the sound mix is done under the assumption that the listener's focus will be on the sound. In second year I took a module called Audio for Visual Media, and as the final assignment we had to adopt the visual media paradigm; the task was to produce a professional-level soundtrack for a short section of a film.

## Pan's Labyrinth

We chose two sections from [Pan's Labyrinth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/) combining a good amount of dialogue and sound effects. In general, sound production in film breaks down into four categories: sound effects, Foley, ADR and music. This assignment was done in groups of four, so each of us took on one task. I was in charge of ADR, or automated dialogue replacement, meaning re-dubbing the dialogue. This mostly consisted of the dialogue in the scene where the Faun instructs Ofelia to retrieve the mandrake root from the pale man's halls and place it under her mother's bed. In addition, I was in charge of the breathing, panting and other voice effects by Ofelia in the subsequent chase scene.

The final clip is embedded below:

The ADR work was challenging because the film is originally in Spanish. Having watched my fair share of dubbed films as a child, I remember how awkward it is when the actor's voice doesn't match the mouth movements. I did my best to translate into English using the same number of words per line, and even went as far as looking for synonyms of words that fit the mouth movements more closely. The voice acting for Ofelia's lines was done by my girlfriend, who just happened to be visiting when I did the recording sessions, and which explains the American accent. I was able to get a staff member from the electronics department to dub the Faun's lines, which I then processed using a variety of filters to achieve a more fantastic, ominous tone. 

All four group members did the mixing and mastering together and the result was surprisingly good, though I do think that the soundtrack ended up dominating more than it should have. Overall it was a very interesting and fun assignment, we spent time brainstorming ways to generate the sounds effects we needed with household objects and did a fair bit of field recording.
